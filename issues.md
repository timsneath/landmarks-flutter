## The good

- Parsing JSON is easier in Dart than Swift

## The bad

- Default [type ramp defined for
  iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/typography/)
  isn't available by default. I had to simulate this with rather unwieldy code.

- `CircleAvatar` and `Divider` widgets have no Cupertino equivalent. I had to
  use the Material ones :(
